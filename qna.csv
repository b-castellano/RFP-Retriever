Provisioning access follows defined and documented processes for granting new or modified levels of information technology system access. Access Authorization Approval Controls Only UnitedHealth Group Leadership can approve Information Technology (IT) system access requests. Managers or a delegated authority may approve access for employees, contractors, or others who report either directly or indirectly to them, or where they have received approval authority from Enterprise Information Security (EIS) to grant access to certain systems. Formal approval must be granted to third parties who approve and manage their third-party employee's and contractor's access to UnitedHealth Group systems. Requests to modify the access rights of an employee or contractor must be approved by his or her manager. Information Owner, or delegate approval is required if determined based upon risk and the classification of the information involved. A manager cannot approve his or her own access. Separation of duties must exist between the request and approval for authorization. Access Authorization Process Access to Information Technology (IT) systems may only be granted when based upon documented business justification and approved by management. Managers are responsible for ensuring that all access that they approve for a user is appropriate to the user's job function. The use of standard UnitedHealth Group provisioning processes and technologies, and corporate role-based access control tools are strongly advised. Periodic Review of General Access Accounts Standard user access will be reviewed by their manager or assigned delegate on a semi-annual basis. A standard user is anyone who is using an information technology (IT) system. UnitedHealth Group may require more frequent access reviews, as determined by internal and external risk drivers. Periodic Review of Privileged Access Accounts Privileged user access will be reviewed at least semi-annually. A privileged user is a user who has been allocated elevated rights within an information technology (IT) system, which are significantly greater than those available to the majority of employees and contractors. Terminations When an employee or contractor leaves UnitedHealth Group or an external party no longer performs services for UnitedHealth Group, the employee's or contractor's manager or business owner responsible for the external party must take appropriate actions, per Self Service on HRdirect, to ensure the employee or contractor is aware of confidential obligations and physical and logical access privileges are revoked in a timely manner. Revoking Access Managers promptly notify the relevant Human Resource (HR) organization of all terminated employees or contractors: Platform access must be revoked as soon as possible, but no later than two (2) business days after termination. When an employee is involuntarily terminated via disciplinary action, platform access is revoked immediately. UnitedHealth Group reserves the right to end active sessions where an employee may already be authenticated to the network Application access is revoked within 10 business days The employee or contractor must return all computing devices (i.e. workstations and laptops), Smart Cards, removable media.

These worst-case scenarios cover impacts from all types of disasters, both natural and human-caused. The following scenarios are provided as planning recovery objectives: Loss of Facility: Complete interruption of facilities without access to its equipment, local data and content. The interruption may impact a single site or multiple sites in a geographic region. Loss of Critical People: Complete interruption with 100% loss of personnel within the first 24 hours and 50% loss of personnel long-term. The interruption may impact a single site or multiple sites in a geographic area. Loss of Critical Systems: Complete interruption and/or access of critical systems and data located at the various Data Centers for an extended period. Loss of Critical Vendors: Complete interruption in a service or supply provided by a third-party vendor(s). Recovery from anything less than complete interruption will be achieved for these scenarios by using appropriate portions of the plan. After clearly defining the business recovery objectives, our teams develop recovery strategies needed to meet these objectives. These recovery strategies vary between Business Segment and the overall criticality rating of the business function or process, which provides guidance on a minimum recovery time objective. We update business continuity plans a minimum of twice annually and exercise annually.', 'INTERNAL NOTE: We do update quarterly but the preferred language is ""a minimum of twice annually"" UnitedHealth Group developed an Enterprise Resiliency & Response Program that minimizes customer impact from disrupted service in a significant event or disaster, while aiding compliance to published regulatory guidelines. We have plans to address all natural and human-caused disasters (i.e. hurricanes, floods, fires, terrorism, and pandemics). The business continuity plans focus on critical business functions and planning for the worst-case scenario so that we can react quickly and efficiently, adding value to our business and customers through effective risk reduction, compliance with industry, contractual or regulatory standards, and safeguarding of operations and assets. UnitedHealth Group\'s business impact analysis and subsequent business continuity plans are written to accommodate the following four scenarios: Loss of Facility: Complete interruption of facilities without access to its equipment, local data, and content. The interruption may impact a single site or multiple sites in a geographic region. Recovery from anything less than complete interruption will be achieved by using appropriate portions of the plan. Loss of Critical People: Complete interruption with 100% loss of personnel within the first 24 hours and 50% loss of personnel long-term. The interruption may impact a single site or multiple sites in a geographic area. Recovery from anything less than complete interruption will be achieved by using appropriate portions of the plan. Loss of Critical Systems: Complete interruption and/or access of critical systems and data located at the various UnitedHealth Group data centers for an extended period of time. Recovery from anything less than complete interruption will be achieved by using appropriate portions of the plan. Loss of Critical Vendor: Complete interruption in a service or supply provided by a third-party vendor. Recovery from anything less than complete interruption will be achieved by using appropriate portions of the plan. The impact of the operational loss due to one, or all, of these scenarios is assessed as part of the original Business Impact Analysis and annually thereafter. The business continuity plans are updated a minimum of twice annually and exercised annually. Business continuity plans are leveraged as needed to address all forms of emergencies, which may impact business operations including short and long-term events. Examples of short-term events include power outages and winter weather office closings. These plans also address more severe, long-term situations, such as building fires and major hurricanes. As a matter of good practice, UnitedHealth Group does not disclose specific information concerning business disruptions. UnitedHealth Group has never needed to implement our disaster recovery plans in response to a catastrophic outage of technology at our production data centers. Business functions classified as critical generally provide for near immediate failover of core services by leveraging geographically dispersed, redundant operations and maintaining a recovery time objective of 72 hours or less. The plans are written to respond to a disaster lasting a minimum of 90 days. In the event a disaster impacts our members, we will comply with any and all emergency orders mandated by the state Department of Insurance, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), or Health and Human Services (HHS).

Is there a policy or process for the backup of production data? Are backup integrity and related restoration procedures tested at least annually? Are backup and restoration errors reviewed and resolved as required? Are data backups encrypted?,"['Yes', 'INTERNAL NOTE: Strategy for Tape Management – In 2019-2020 we migrated away from using physical tape for long-term data retention. Currently, only unexpired data resides on tape. Company information must be backed up on a regularly scheduled basis to ensure availability of Company information and limit data loss in the event of an outage. UnitedHealth Group Optum Technology or the business organization information technology groups are responsible for developing, documenting, and implementing backup schedules. This includes outlining the type of backup, interval, storage location, and the number of copies for all Company information under their control. Appropriate business and technical owners are accountable for determining what assets are backed-up per UnitedHealth Group\'s Classification Levels. Backups may include but are not limited to: Master files databases Transactions files System programs/utilities, Application software Parameter settings, or System documentation UnitedHealth Group maintains sole custody of the data at all times by transmitting over our secured channels. UnitedHealth Group is the sole entity in the chain of custody for the data, and has opted to encrypt the data, at the time the media is written, for risk mitigation purposes. The data encryption occurs at the time the tape media is created using industry accepted encryption algorithms (256-Bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)). UnitedHealth Group invests significant resources in its information security program and uses a number of network, security monitoring, and encryption technologies to protect our environment and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the data and information entrusted to us. In both mainframe and distributed environments, UnitedHealth Group’s strategy is to encrypt data at rest without regard to its content or type at the storage media (device) level on both disk and tape. The primary and secondary locations are not fixed entities and can change based on business demands and operational need (i.e. growth, expansion or disaster recovery). In the mainframe environment, UnitedHealth Group uses geographically dispersed mainframes for ""Rapid Recovery"" that use UnitedHealth Group\'s internally secured networks to transmit the backup data. In this situation, UnitedHealth Group maintains sole custody of all data at both primary and secondary locations. In addition, UnitedHealth Group has implemented several mitigating controls to ensure data is protected, such as in sourcing of its tape management facilities, implementing a Rapid Recovery solution to ensure data is protected and available should there be a situation requiring the recovery of data, onsite process for data eradication of disk drives that are replaced during maintenance, and data eradication on all decommissioned storage arrays to Department of Defense (DOD) standards prior to leaving UnitedHealth Group\'s controlled facilities further mitigate the risk of exposure. Operational Backups The Data Protection Infrastructure exists in all primary technology centers. Data is segregated by production/non-production and functional characteristics (i.e. Wintel, UNIX, Database, Archive).

Encryption keys are created entirely within the systems themselves and are not visible, recognizable, or changeable by any administrator. There is no external list. Even if encryption is turned off, encrypted data cannot be “read” or deciphered by any individual. The encryption keys are managed several different ways depending on environment: In the mainframe environment, the encryption keys are managed remotely using the IBM product SKLM (Secure Key Lifecycle Manager).

Users are granted minimum necessary access to allow them to perform their job responsibilities. To access UnitedHealth Group information technology systems, all users must authenticate with a unique user ID and password to verify the person or entity seeking access is the one claimed. Periodic reviews of user accounts must occur to ensure the appropriate minimum privileges are granted and accounts of unauthorized users have been removed. UnitedHealth Group utilizes an industry standard full disk encryption product on its laptops, which meets the NIST encryption standards. UnitedHealth Group continues to implement new solutions with advanced technologies to ensure customer data is protected. At the beginning of 2007, UnitedHealth Group began maintaining its own tape management storage facility within its managed data centers.

In both mainframe and distributed environments, UnitedHealth Group’s strategy is to encrypt data at rest without regard to its content or type at the storage media (device) level on both disk and tape. The standard/methodology utilized for encryption is Data at Rest Encryption (DARE) using Self Encrypting Drives (SED) with a minimum AES-256 bit cypher key and validated FIPS 140-2 compliance. Encryption Key Management When a storage array is placed into production, the encryption key is enabled. All data that is subsequently written to that array, regardless of type, origin or classification, is encrypted. UHG does not “partially” encrypt its arrays. Encryption keys are created entirely within the systems themselves and are not visible, recognizable, or changeable by any administrator. There is no external list. Even if encryption is turned off, encrypted data cannot be “read” or deciphered by any individual. The encryption keys are managed several different ways depending on environment: In the mainframe environment, the encryption keys are managed remotely using the IBM product SKLM (Secure Key Lifecycle Manager). This remote key manager is responsible for any maintenance related to the array encryption keys. In the distributed core environment, the encryption keys are either managed remotely using the HP product ESKM (Enterprise Secure Key Manager) This remote key manager is responsible for any maintenance related to the array encryption keys. OR For the arrays, the encryption keys are managed locally on the Storage array. The keys are created, stored and duplicated within the memory/controller subsystem of the array. Secondary backups of these keys are created and stored on the array management station in case of storage array failure.

Optum Technology’s data centers are protected using cloud based DDoS detection and mitigation services. This service is primarily intended to detect and deflect volumetric attacks but can be also be used to mitigate low traffic volume attacks designed to exhaust hosting and other resources. Traffic patterns for key portals and groups of hosts providing like services are tracked historically to create a traffic baseline. Thresholds and other metrics are configured for each of these tracking groups for the purposes of alerting anomalous activity. Should Optum Technology’s internal tools and the service provider detect an attack, Optum can quickly invoke mitigation which routes inbound traffic through the provider’s many traffic scrubbers where various countermeasures are applied and tuned based on the attack type. Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) solutions are deployed within the UnitedHealth Group infrastructure to detect and prevent malicious traffic. The IDS/IPS systems detect known attack characteristics of malware and report into UnitedHealth Group’s formal incident response process. IPS systems prevent action of detected malicious traffic and report all incidents per the process. UnitedHealth Group Optum Technology manages IDS/IPS devices throughout its infrastructure with a dedicated security team. All IDS/IPS devices report to a central management system for day-to-day support, maintenance, and signature updates. Signature updates are examined in coordination with signature releases. IDS/IPS signatures are updated, as needed, for each environment at least weekly. UnitedHealth Group uses commercial IDS/IPS and subscribes to best practices for all known signatures and behaviors. Specific details on the internal workings of IDS and IPS are confidential and not supplied outside of UnitedHealth Group Optum Technology Security Services. In addition, UnitedHealth Group Optum Technology monitors the following sites: National Vulnerability Database (NVD), CERT, ISS, Microsoft Patch Tuesday, Adobe Patch updates, iDefense Labs threat feed, and others for newly released vulnerabilities. All IDS/IPS' are configured to log events that are transported to UnitedHealth Group's Security Event Information Management (SEIM) solutions for event correlation. Intrusion Prevention Systems must be deployed at Internet Points of Presence (IPOP) and where determined necessary by UnitedHealth Group Optum Technology. IDS/IPS technology will be deployed on UnitedHealth Group networks where there is defined segmentation authorized by UnitedHealth Group Optum Technology.

UnitedHealth Group's key management system includes standards, procedures and secure methods for: - Generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications - Generating and obtaining public key certificates - Distributing keys to intended users including how keys should be activated when received - Storing keys including how authorized users obtain access to keys - Changing or updating keys including rules on when keys should be changed and how this will be done - Dealing with compromised keys - Revoking keys including how keys should be withdrawn or deactivated - Recovering keys that are lost or corrupted as part of business continuity management - Archiving keys - Destroying keys - Logging and auditing of key management related activities Per UnitedHealth Group policy and standard, to protect against potential compromise, encryption keys must expire and be renewed periodically to protect against potential compromise. The following guidelines must be used: Crypto services Key Management Systems, (KMS) are FIPS 140-2 level 1 and/or level 3 compliant 1. The key lifetime is based upon the data the key protects and changed periodically (i.e. semi-annually) to help protect the key is protected from anyone who is unauthorized use. 2. Key history is maintained for expired keys in a secure and reliable storage facility The selected algorithm used to encrypt data must utilize a tested and best practice standard (i.e. AES-256). This will help ensure the algorithm selected has been proven difficult to compromise or would take too long to enumerate. Symmetric (single key) encryption will necessitate a key length of at least 256 bits with the exception of full disk encryption. Examples include: a. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) b. Asymmetric (dual key) encryption will require a key length of at least 2048 bits. Asymmetric (dual key) encryption may only use the following key exchange algorithms: a. Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA). b. Elliptical Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE). c. Elliptical Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) d. Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE); must be 2048 bits or higher Cipher signing may only use the following algorithms: a. Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA) b. Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) c. Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA); must be 2048 bits or higher In the event of a conflict, local regulatory encryption requirements will take precedence Secure hash algorithms will be used to create a message digest with a minimum length of 256 bits. Examples include: a. SHA-512 b. SHA-256 SHA-384 Whenever technically possible, AES with the key length of at least 256 will be used for the encryption algorithm because of its strength and speed. UnitedHealth Group utilizes an industry standard full disk encryption tool on all UnitedHealth Group workstations. Encryption is required on removable storage devices when confidential or protected data (i.e. ePHI, PII, passwords) is saved to the device. When AES encryption processes are employed, the key management system must support Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data, (AEAD). Implementation of AEAD will require of one of the following, HMAC-SHA (256,384,512) when Cipher Block Chaining, (CBC) mode is required GCM for confidentiality and authenticity of additional data Encryption key owners are responsible for the protection and management of public and private encryption keys entrusted to them. Key deployment and storage needs to be processed in a secure method per UnitedHealth Group's Encryption Security Standard. Key management controls will be reviewed on an annual basis by the key management owner to help determine whether adjustments are necessary. Self-signed certificates that are in use must be registered and managed with approved IT processes Keys need to be backed up in the case a recovery is necessary. All encryption processes running on the Company Information technology systems (i.e. e‐mail and/or any application using encryption services) must include centralized key management and recovery functions, which may only be accessed by authorized employees and contractors. Access is granted in accordance with job roles and responsibilities and approval by management. In the event of a conflict with UnitedHealth Group policies and operating standards , local regulatory encryption requirements will take precedence. UnitedHealth Group policy prohibits the sharing of Private (encryption) Keys with third parties or vendors due to the risk of compromise. If mutual authentication is required by a third party or vendor, they are responsible for creating a Private Key and providing UnitedHealth Group with the Public Key to be trusted.

When an approved VPN user logs on to an endpoint through a non-corporate network (wired or wireless), a VPN connection is made to the UHG corporate network by a client agent on their device. The VPN agent on the device is enabled for automatic reconnect, automatic detection of trusted networks, and utilizes machine and user authentication. The deployed Employee VPN solution requires that when a UHG company-owned device is connected to a non-corporate network (wired or wireless) it must then connect to the UHG corporate network. This ensures that the endpoint and the ingress and egress connections are secure and protected per enterprise security standards and policies. This also ensures that all monitoring, filtering, data protection, and malware protection is in place regardless of what network is used to connect. It also allows for monitoring of vulnerabilities and configuration management of endpoints. Multi-factor authentication is accomplished by first using biometrics, physical smartcard, soft or hard token, and/or a complex pin/password for access to the company-owned device. Machine domain/LDAP authentication provides an additional layer of system level protection along with a digital machine certificate for machine level authentication. Endpoint protection uses a user digital certificate of system authentication.

UnitedHealth Group can sustain our essential services ‘Indefinitely’ from an alternate recovery site. While our plans are written for a minimum of a 90-day outage, we would work with Enterprise Real Estate to ensure we had long-term alternate space available, if needed. UnitedHealth Group has a robust Disaster Recovery Program. UnitedHealth Group relies on a diverse array of interconnected information systems to meet the needs of its clients. The goal of disaster recovery planning is to protect the organization in the event all or key aspects of operations are rendered unusable. Preparedness is the key. The company has instituted an Enterprise Disaster Recovery Program to first eliminate or reduce disaster recovery risk in critical technology areas and then plans for the facilitation and of timely and predictable restoration of key applications, data, and supporting critical infrastructure. The mission of the Enterprise Disaster Recovery Program is to minimize the aggregate risk and impact to UnitedHealth Group from the occurrence of disaster recovery events. Below are the objectives of the Enterprise Disaster Recovery Program that are in support of the mission: Provide a “systems solution” that accommodates the interdependencies between business processes and applications Drive systemic improvements in DR capability (e.g. Recovery Time Objective (RTO), etc.) Recognizing funding and time constraints, evolve and improve the DR capability in a manner that provides greatest good for greatest number Provide DR requirements as part of UnitedHealth Group’s systems architecture, delivery and operations as opposed to an after-thought once a new application goes into production Develop and deploy a modular, adaptive set of capabilities rather than one size fits all Deal with the most probable DR scenarios in addition to worst case “smoking hole” In addition to protecting UnitedHealth Group’s on-going viability, make the disaster recovery capability a competitive strength that can be leveraged in the market. UnitedHealth Group’s approach to disaster recovery is based on the two fundamentals: prevention and protection. A focus on balancing the combination of disaster prevention and protection results in reducing both the probability and impact of a disaster. UnitedHealth Group has instituted an Enterprise Disaster Recovery (EDR) Program to first eliminate or reduce disaster risk in critical technology areas, and then plan for facilitation and the timely and predictable restoration of key applications, data, and supporting critical infrastructure. Business functions classified as critical generally provide for near immediate failover of core services by leveraging geographically dispersed redundant operations and maintain a recovery time objective of 72 hours or less. While UnitedHealth Group does not provide a guaranteed maximum time for resumption, the application's Recovery Time Objective (RTOs) are communicated to and agreed upon by the business. At the time of a disaster, an assessment will be performed and the restoration order will be determined by a Master Recovery Timeline. Depending upon the system component, the following recovery capabilities solutions will be implemented to include Rapid Recovery, Hot, Warm. We measure/define applications readiness by RTO and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

In direct support of UnitedHealth Group’s Cyber Defense Engineering (CDE) mission, CDE operates four primary capabilities: Intelligence & Threat Management (ITM): The ITM team is a proactive cyber intelligence focused team actively conducting threat hunting, cyber intelligence, attack surface and threat analysis. ITM provides intelligence analysis based on open source data, purchased intelligence sources and UHG data focusing on threats to UnitedHealth Group and its shared industry verticals. ITM also conducts proactive network and log analysis to identify threats within the UnitedHealth Group network and its perimeter that are not being identified by current security devices/applications. Active Cyber Defense (ACD): The ACD team is one of the security control testing functions within EIS. It conducts adversary simulation (red team), attack replay, continual security assessments, and AE posture testing. ACD’s purpose is to measure the actual effectiveness of UnitedHealth Group's security program, reduce the uncertainty about the IT security risks the company faces, and effectively demonstrate to senior decision makers the possible consequences of cyber-attacks against the business. Additionally, given the significant degree of dependence of security measures on human processes, ACD operations are also designed to provide users and security staff real-life experience in how to respond to cyber attacks based on highly realistic scenarios conducted in their day-to-day environment. Data Analytics & Security Innovations (DASI): The DASI team serves as the EIS Data Analytics, Engineering, and Development group, conducting advanced statistical analysis of security data; managing the EIS Big Data Repositories; and creating alerting and reporting for security analysts. DASI supports data ingestion and resulting use cases in the EIS Big Data repositories and supporting applications. Continuous Monitoring & Improvement (CMI): The CMI team is the dedicated function within EIS focused upon the measuring, analysis, and remediation of gaps in visibility, operational capabilities and security posture. CMI direction and priorities are driven by the security tool score card, Cyber Defense Register, war rooms/incidents based upon security tool failure and other leadership objectives. CMI’s Data Utilization group supports the other functions within CDE and Cyber Defense Operations, operationalizing their findings through development of use cases, enhancing the capabilities of the enterprise security sensors, and improving the detection capabilities to reduce time to identification of threats within the enterprise.""]","Dobrotka, David"

The EIS organization is responsible for maintaining an effective security posture and protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of UnitedHealth Group information assets. This is performed, in part, through the development, approval, publication, and maintenance of the EIS Policy and Security Standards. These Standards are based on multiple security frameworks and influenced by various regulatory and industry standards and best practices such as HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, and FISMA. Such standards and regulations are harmonized to map and support multiple compliance requirements and assessed annually against the HITRUST Security Framework. EIS coordinates with the corporate and business organization’s senior leadership, and key stakeholders to develop, publish, and maintain the information security policies, control standards, security standards, guidelines, and baselines to meet the enterprises’ business, legal, and regulatory needs. These policies and standards apply to all employees and entities throughout the enterprise and are formally reviewed each year. Updates are made as necessary based on new regulations, technologies, or business landscape. The Enterprise Security policies and guidelines are divided into 14 standards.

61d5a8e58fecd3770d0811b0,What methods are used to verify system security?,What methods are used to verify system security?,"['Various methodologies are used to verify system security including, but not limited to: Security baseline configuration scanning of servers to validate that systems are in compliance with security baselines. Baseline scans are executed on a monthly basis for regulated systems and bi-annually scans are completed for all non-regulated systems. Risk assessments are performed in order to determine the security controls required based on the use, risk, legal, regulatory, customer, and Corporate Security requirements associated with the Information Technology System. The process includes: Defining Roles and Responsibilities: Roles and responsibilities for guiding, performing, and monitoring risk assessment activities, implementing required information security controls, and requesting risk decisions or remediation plans are defined in the information risk assessment. Identifying Risks: This is the identification of what, why, and how events arise as the basis for further analysis. Risk sensing techniques such as data analysis, industry trends, and early threat indicators are utilized to focus risk analysis activities. Targeted risk assessments focus on specific areas of interest. Results from these assessments may influence other assessment activities. Analyzing Risks: This is the determination of existing controls and the analysis of risks in terms of the impact and likelihood in the context of those controls. The analysis considers the range of potential threats and how likely those threats are to occur. Impact and likelihood are combined to produce an estimated level of risk. The Enterprise Information Risk Assessment (EIRA) reviews threat scenarios pertinent to the business and analyzes controls mitigating those threats to determine residual risk. Evaluating Risks: This is a comparison of estimated risk levels against pre-established criteria which enables risks to be ranked and prioritized. Risk frameworks are leveraged to drive consistent risk decisions. Communicating Risk Decisions: This involves the communication of information risk decisions and tracking/ documenting information risk management activities. Operational Compliance Monitoring: This includes review and testing of existing requirements supporting information security standards. Examples of the methodologies used to verify application security at UnitedHealth Group are listed below: Company development initiatives must follow a formal and approved development methodology, such as the Optum Scalable Agile Method (OSAM) Process. As part of the security development lifecycle, the use of Static Code Analyst tools and Dynamic Web Site testing are performed against applications before they are deployed into production. As part of the normal lifecycle of an application, based on risk, penetration testing is also performed on an annual regular basis. Where possible, application developers will rely on proven security implementations and controls, such as operating system authentication, certified software, and certified encryption processes rather than re-creating security functionality.']","Hicks, Diane"

The Business Impact Analysis (BIA), combined with threat and risk assessments, helps assure that business continuity risks are appropriately prioritized and remediated by applying cost-effective strategies and mechanisms to reduce risk to a tolerable level. In order to make sure the business impact analysis accurately reflects the business risk, executives who have responsibility for the functional area are engaged and guided through the risk assessment process by business continuity subject matter experts. When the BIA is complete, the enterprise team reviews the final material to verify the analysis meets UnitedHealth Group standards for quality and completeness. The Enterprise Business Impact Analysis process: identifies potential impact of uncontrolled, nonspecific events on UnitedHealth Group business processes and its customers considers all business segment functions, not just IT or data processing provides an estimation of maximum allowable downtime and acceptable levels of data and operational loss The Business Impact Analysis includes an analysis of business processes and criticality, site locations, vital record data, system dependencies, internal dependencies, external dependencies, processing metrics, outage impact analysis, and recovery objectives. When the BIA is complete, it is used to create the Business Continuity Plan and related IT Disaster Recovery Plans. In turn, once the BIA is completed, tested, and certified, it becomes the ongoing source of truth. Annually thereafter, a risk assessment process is utilized to provide on-going alignment with the changing organization. Information security controls are documented by UnitedHealth Group Optum Technology and are independent of business-specific business continuity plans and application-specific disaster recovery plans. We verify that these controls continue to be in effect whenever recovery plans are being used to actively respond to an event. Due to the sensitive nature of the information, the detailed business impact analysis and our complete business continuity exercise results are considered proprietary and confidential. For audit purposes, the plans may be viewed in a controlled environment with UnitedHealth Group subject matter experts available to answer questions. The results may not be copied or removed after the meeting. This policy is in place to protect not only UnitedHealth Group operations and employees, but also the security, integrity, and confidentiality of protected information.

Roles and responsibilities for guiding, performing, and monitoring risk assessment activities, implementing required controls, and requesting risk records will be clearly defined. The steps below describe the process for requesting a risk record analysis to a UnitedHealth Group Information Security Policy or Control Standard: Business Organization completes a risk assessment (may engage the Segment Information Security Officer (SISO) to assist) and submits a risk record request. A Business and Information Technology (IT) owner approval or employees or contractors can submit with their Manager identified The Enterprise Information Security Organization (EIS) and the SISO review, rank, and work with appropriate parties for approval The Enterprise Information Security Organization notifies the requestor of approval or denial and required compensating controls and/or remediation items, if any, that the requestor must address for approval The Enterprise Information Security Organization tracks the status/expiration of the risk record requests going forward, progress on compensating controls and/or remediation items committed by the requestor, and provides metrics to appropriate parties on a regular basis. EIS performs a risk analysis for each risk record through engagement with the appropriate subject matter experts (e.g. Legal counsel, compliance, and technology owners). The risk rating is based on factors such as: Inherent risks Information types (Public Information, Confidential Information or Protected Information) Exposure (internal or external) Volume Mitigating controls Legal/Regulatory compliance (e.g. HIPAA, ARRA) In addition to the risk record analysis, UnitedHealth Group conducts a recurring Enterprise Information Risk Assessment. The scope of the assessment include identification of information security risks that are applicable to the UnitedHealth Group enterprise and a determination of whether those risks are adequately controlled. The UnitedHealth Group Enterprise Information Risk Assessment data is refreshed on an ongoing basis as the risks and controls to address risks continue to evolve.""]","Swanson, Matthew"

If encryption is required, only approved encryption tools may be used. UnitedHealth Group personnel, third party consultants, contractors, and vendors may not implement encryption, digital signatures, digital certificates or key escrow tools without prior authorization from Enterprise Information Security. The selected algorithm used to encrypt data utilizes a tested and best practice standard. To safeguard confidential and protected health information, UnitedHealth Group requires e-mails containing sensitive data to be encrypted using Secure Delivery before being sent outside the company\'s e-mail network. In addition, UnitedHealth Group utilizes industry leading tools to scan unencrypted e-mails that are attempted to be sent outside the company\'s network to check for confidential, sensitive, or protected health information. If unprotected sensitive data is found, the e-mail will be returned to the sender with a delivery failure notice and instructions to send the e-mail using Secure Delivery.

Mitigation Activities Mitigating action plans for risks, which have been assessed to be most critical are developed by the business with the support of ERM and monitored continuously by ERM through completion. Key risk indicators (KRI) and key performance indicators (KPI) are defined and tracked for identified risks.

The following guidelines must be used: Crypto services Key Management Systems, (KMS) are FIPS 140-2 level 1 and/or level 3 compliant - The key lifetime is based upon the data the key protects and changed periodically (i.e. semi-annually) to help protect the key is protected from anyone who is unauthorized use. - Key history is maintained for expired keys in a secure and reliable storage facility The selected algorithm used to encrypt data must utilize a tested and best practice standard (i.e. AES-256). This will help ensure the algorithm selected has been proven difficult to compromise or would take too long to enumerate. Symmetric (single key) encryption will necessitate a key length of at least 256 bits with the exception of full disk encryption. Examples include: - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) - Asymmetric (dual key) encryption will require a key length of at least 2048 bits. Asymmetric (dual key) encryption may only use the following key exchange algorithms: - Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA). - Elliptical Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE). - Elliptical Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) - Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE); must be 2048 bits or higher Cipher signing may only use the following algorithms: - Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA) - Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) In the event of a conflict, local regulatory encryption requirements will take precedence Secure hash algorithms will be used to create a message digest with a minimum length of 256 bits. Examples include: - SHA-512 - SHA-256 - SHA-384 Whenever technically possible, AES with the key length of at least 256 will be used for the encryption algorithm because of its strength and speed. UnitedHealth Group utilizes an industry standard full disk encryption tool on all UnitedHealth Group workstations. Encryption is required on removable storage devices when confidential or protected data (i.e. ePHI, PII, passwords) is saved to the device. When AES encryption processes are employed, the key management system must support Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data, (AEAD). Implementation of AEAD will require of one of the following, HMAC-SHA (256,384,512) when Cipher Block Chaining, (CBC) mode is required GCM for confidentiality and authenticity of additional data Encryption key owners are responsible for the protection and management of public and private encryption keys entrusted to them. Key deployment and storage needs to be processed in a secure method per UnitedHealth Group's Encryption Security Standard. Key management controls will be reviewed on an annual basis by the key management owner to help determine whether adjustments are necessary. Self-signed certificates that are in use must be registered and managed with approved IT processes Keys need to be backed up in the case a recovery is necessary. All encryption processes running on the Company Information technology systems (i.e. e‐mail and/or any application using encryption services) must include centralized key management and recovery functions, which may only be accessed by authorized employees and contractors. Access is granted in accordance with job roles and responsibilities and approval by management. In the event of a conflict with UnitedHealth Group policies and operating standards , local regulatory encryption requirements will take precedence. UnitedHealth Group policy prohibits the sharing of Private (encryption) Keys with third parties or vendors due to the risk of compromise.

Enterprise Information Security (EIS) The mission of EIS is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of UnitedHealth Group's information assets through the implementation and management of an Enterprise Information Security program. The role of Optum’s EIS is to provide clear policies and standards that guide who we serve and respond to the risk we face. The EIS program is risk-focused, including customer and regulatory requirements, to provide services that protect and safeguard data and the Company’s systems commensurate with identified risk and at quality levels to support internal and external customers. EIS identifies, enables, and provides core security and fraud controls within the fabric of the platforms and applications that sustain our business, and educates employees on how to design, build and operate systems that are secure. In addition, EIS provides sound and sustainable operational oversight for the technologies that monitor and defend our customers and Company. UnitedHealth Group maintains a Policy Center for access by employees of key policies. Internal control processes are implemented to comply with regulations (e.g., SOX, MAR, FDICIA). The EIS organization is made up of four functional units that manage the evolving risk landscape and provide a clear and executable security roadmap driving long-term IOI and optimization of Optum. Data is protected through the following functional EIS units: Information Risk Management: Enabling a foundation for common risk framework designed to identify and manage risk across the organization in support of critical business objectives and regulatory compliance. Cyber Defense Operations: Protecting and managing UnitedHealth Group’s information and brand by monitoring, responding to, and reporting cyber threats and vulnerabilities through investigative and intelligence services Global Strategic Acquisitions: Increase cyber resiliency around UHG’s Non-Integrated Entities and global businesses through onboarding and implementation of our security best practice. Security Solutions and Engineering: Drive engineering excellence within the organization and provide security engineering services and vulnerability insights to enhance the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information entrusted to us. Enterprise Resiliency and Response (ER&R): The purpose of UnitedHealth Group’s ER&R Program is to be prepared to respond and mitigate the impact of events that could disrupt UnitedHealth Group business by containing the impact within a predictable and predetermined period of time. Effective business continuity planning establishes the basis from which business processes and operations, including service to customers, are resumed. Supplier Risk Management (SRM) Program The Company has deployed a SRM Program that is managed by the Enterprise Sourcing & Procurement (ES&P) organization. The program encompasses a set of common standards applicable to suppliers managed by ES&P. This program serves as a governance structure for supplier risk management as part of the supplier contracting and onboarding process to ensure acceptable contractual terms are secured and suppliers are held to the Company’s Code of Conduct. UnitedHealth Group has an Enterprise Vendor Risk Council (the “Council”) to govern and oversee supplier risk management and compliance. The Council consists of key leaders from various risk areas such as: ES&P, EIS, C&E, Privacy, Legal, and UHC/Optum operating segments. The Council meets regularly and has established a mission and objectives, including ensuring that business owners are notified of significant supplier relationship issues. The mission and objectives of the Enterprise Vendor Risk Council are ratified annually. Legal Compliance and Regulatory Affairs (LCRA) LCRA is responsible for the delivery of legal; regulatory affairs and compliance support services to all parts of UnitedHealth Group. LCRA strives to provide services that help advance the Company’s mission while mitigating legal, compliance and regulatory risk. LCRA includes, among other things, Corporate Governance, the Corporate Privacy Office, Enhanced Data Use Controls, Technology and Intellectual Property, Litigation support, Office of Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC)/Sanctions Check and Regulatory Affairs. The team manages many regulatory filings associated with our regulated subsidiaries. The Corporate Governance team manages the governance activities of our subsidiaries across the enterprise We maintain high levels of compliance with applicable regulatory requirements while also meeting the unique business needs of each subsidiary by prioritizing the following tasks: Maintain high levels of quality and efficiency of corporate governance practices for managed entities; Facilitating business goals through strong relationships with LCRA as well as with business teams across the enterprise; and Interpreting and applying applicable statutes and regulations, including those related to the Insurance Holding Company Act. Internal Audit & Advisory Services (IAAS) The purpose of IAAS is to enhance UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries success by providing reasonable and objective assurance regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls through review, assessment, education, and consultation. The Company’s General Auditor reports administratively to the Chief Accounting Officer and functionally to the UnitedHealth Group Audit Committee. IAAS assists the UnitedHealth Group Audit Committee, regulated entity audit committees and management in evaluating and improving the organization’s risk management, internal control, governance and quality improvement processes. This is accomplished primarily through review and assessment of internal controls within the Company. IAAS uses a systematic, disciplined, and independent approach, while operating cooperatively and communicating openly with management. IAAS’s scope of work is to evaluate whether the Company’s risk management, internal controls, governance and quality improvement processes, as designed and represented by management, are adequate and operating effectively, and to assist management in developing improvement plans where necessary. The IAAS scope is established based on ERM Key Risks as well as other specific considerations. IAAS provides direct support for management’s attestation requirements under SOX, MAR, and FDICIA by testing the design and operational effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The Company uses Company policies to specify responsibility and accountability within and between business management and centralized risk management and compliance functions. Delegation of Authority (DOA) The Company’s Board of Directors has approved a DOA policy that establishes the specific transactions and related spending limits, if applicable, that must be approved by the Board. Examples of designated Board approved transactions are: the Board must approve the Company’s annual operating plan, capital budget and strategic plan; the Board must approve mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, partnerships and minority equity interests in each case where the consideration to be paid or received by the Company is in excess of $100,000,000. The Board delegates authority to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company who may further sub-delegate authority to Management via the Company’s DOA policy. Company management utilizes the DOA policy to segregate binding authority (contracting decisions) and payment authority (spending decisions) by management and function. The authority levels vary by role within the organization from management-level positions to the executive officers and the Board of Directors and committees, thereof. The policy is available to employees on the Company’s Policy Center secure intranet website. In addition, a separate intranet website has been developed to facilitate the process and is available for access by employees. An online training course is required for employees at a specific level of employment and/or depending upon their role within the organization. An Oversight Committee approves the policy and any policy exceptions and/or substantive changes to commitment approvals providing strategic direction and oversight for the DOA Program.""]","Swanson, Matt"
61d5a8f28fecd3770d08131d,Does your company have a pandemic response?,N/A,"['Yes', 'Pandemic Response: UnitedHealth Group policies and standards for a pandemic are part of our company’s overall emergency preparedness planning and are designed to be comprehensive and allow flexibility in implementation given the nature of the crisis. These policies and standards have been validated through pandemic planning activity, including pandemic simulated exercises, which have challenged the viability of these policies and standards given a public health crisis. We have developed a contingency process and plans that minimize customer impact from disrupted service in a significant event or disaster while aiding compliance to published regulatory guidelines. This recovery strategy focuses on our critical business functions and planning for the worst-case scenario. The critical business functions have developed business continuity plans. These functions include, but are not limited to, customer/provider call services, claims processing services, clinical and pharmaceutical services, banking operations, and core corporate functions. We also maintain formal disaster recovery plans for our critical technology and systems infrastructure components supporting our most critical business functions. Business Continuity Plans are developed to address a situation in which 50% of the workforce may be unavailable and where multiple sites in a region may be affected for a continuous period of three months or longer. As a national company, we have geographically-dispersed staff that will support and supplement the work of any compromised localities. A variety of business continuity strategies may be deployed depending on the critical business function ranking and established recovery time objectives. These strategies include: Resilient Operations – includes dual site operations and continuous availability solutions. In the event of an interruption at one site, the business function is transferred to one or more alternate locations at which staff and facilities are already prepared to handle. For example, our National Operations Command Center monitors call volume at our customer care centers enterprise-wide to coordinate work volumes and respond quickly to any load balance needs. Remote Working – includes the concept of working from home or telecommuting and working from other non-corporate locations through secured connections. Multiple Shifts – making alternative space available to greater number of staff by dividing staff into two shifts (i.e, morning and evening). Buddy up – makes use of existing in-company accommodations, such as a training facility or lunchrooms to provide recovery space or increasing the office density. Off-loading – consists of off-loading additional critical tasks to staff at available sites or staff set up to effectively work remotely. Displacement – involves displacing of staff performing less urgent business processes with staff performing a higher priority activity. Pandemic specific planning procedures include: Market Medical Directors make contact with local public health officials in order to develop the ability to collaborate in the event of an influenza pandemic. Development of a system which monitors pharmaceutical usage, emergency room usage, and inpatient hospitalizations for the UnitedHealth Group population so that we can monitor such usage and, compare our data to what is reported nationally, and make alterations to UnitedHealth Group policies and procedures as needed on a local, regional or national basis. Clinical policies and programs will continue to be coordinated through our locally based Market Medical Directors who have established relationships with local health care providers, local medical societies, and state and local health departments. Our medical directors work in collaboration with public health agencies and non-governmental organizations to help ensure access to care for our members in the event of a disaster. In addition, we will communicate as necessary with appropriate staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota.']","Carlson, Catherine"

In addition, it is critical to plan for the impact of a public health emergency including pandemics on our customers, members, providers, and our own operations. Through our event management response, we will mobilize the appropriate personnel to ensure we can continue to provide ongoing access to healthcare for our members and customers who may also be impacted by these events. UnitedHealth Group has business contingency planning preventative controls, contingency resources, and procedures administered by a formal internal management organization. UnitedHealth Group has developed a contingency process that minimizes customer impact from disrupted service in a disaster while aiding compliance to published regulatory guidelines. The program strategy requires that the ownership, responsibility, and accountability for business continuity planning reside at the segment business operations level while providing for governance, standardization, and oversight at the enterprise level. The continuity strategy is an appropriate combination of safeguards within our operations that work together to address inter-segment dependencies and meet the business continuity requirements of the segments individually, as well as, UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Risk assessment, organizational accountabilities, governance, and metrics are the foundational components of the program and layered approach. The Program is implemented through an organization structure that requires active participation among all business stakeholders including technology and business operations. The Enterprise Resiliency & Response Steering Committee, comprised of corporate and segment executives, has responsibility for defining the recovery project initiatives, oversight, and support of the program, which is in compliance with regulatory guidelines and customer expectations. Through the Program, the segments have responsibility and accountability to sustain the organization's capacity and readiness to manage a major incident or disaster through to resolution. At the corporate level, the Enterprise Resiliency & Response office and the UnitedHealth Group Optum Technology Disaster Recovery office maintain the standards, controls, testing, and compliance within the program. UnitedHealth Group's Pandemic Plan is embedded within the Enterprise Resiliency & Response Program, which includes business contingency and event management planning preventative controls, contingency resources, and procedures administered by a formal internal management organization and executive steering committee. A formal pandemic coordinator has been assigned. We continue to implement the steps necessary for us to sustain our services in the event of a public health crisis. In the event of a pandemic, you can rest assured that we: Constantly monitor the information provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) for pandemic phase designations. Have initiated our own business continuity strategies and align the implementation of these plans in coordination with WHO pandemic phase designation and severity of the pandemic. Because a pandemic can be unpredictable, we will constantly reassess the situation from local, state, national, and global perspectives and will make decisions on implementation based upon what is warranted during the particular circumstances. As a national company, we have geographically dispersed computing, customer service facilities, and healthcare networks that can support and supplement the work of compromised localities. Have established an Event (Emergency) Management process and team specifically designed to monitor risk to our people and operations and facilitate a timely response to major events affecting our personnel, business operations, and/or site locations with the goal of avoiding or minimizing damage to the organization’s ability to operate. The Event Management Team, serves as the vehicle, which is committed to providing our customers with timely clinical information based upon Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, expert health professionals input, and our real-time experience in serving over 85 million people in local communities across the nation. This team is also responsible for reviewing and providing any information that is relevant to changes in UnitedHealth Group policies and procedures that may affect customers, members, and clinical partners. Will support federal, state, and local health department disease surveillance activities to identify and track disease outbreaks. Will work with our customers to assure that benefit designs and their interpretation will facilitate socially and medically appropriate access to necessary clinical care, medical supplies, vaccines, and pharmaceuticals. Will work with our customers to address and resolve unique issues that may arise during a crisis. We will communicate with members and healthcare practitioners during a crisis using all vehicles that are available and pertinent. Based on the impact and severity of the event, a variety of communications options will be utilized including member and provider portals, member and provider call centers, media communications, and direct communications by account executives to our national accounts. Risk assessment, organizational accountabilities, governance, and metrics are the foundational components of the program and layered approach.""]","Carlson, Catherine"

TMX essentially has two separate internal device IDs that it tracks: the Exact ID, and the Smart ID. 
Exact ID is derived from all the persistent markers or cookies present. If someone visits us on Monday with a particular configuration of cookies, and then returns on Tuesday with the same configuration of cookies, it will be classified as the same Exact ID. If on Wednesday, however, before they return to the website, they clear all cookies and activate incognito mode or an equivalent private browsing mode, their Exact ID on Wednesday would not match that of Monday and Tuesday, because their uniquely-identifying constellation of cookies has changed.
Smart ID is another device ID which is NOT dependent on these cookies or tokens. The exact methodology for deriving a device's Smart ID is TMX's protected methodology, but essentially it looks at device attributes like font list, browser plugins, user agent, etc. to create a picture of the device which is not dependent on cookies.
To put it concisely - Exact ID thinks of a separate ""device"" as a configuration of cookies, and will be masked by private browsing, Smart ID is not changed by private browsing or deleting cookies.
In both cases, all an agent in TMX sees is a long alphanumeric string used as a unique internal identifier.
High Level summary for Clients in writing:

When an approved VPN user logs on to an endpoint through a non-corporate network (wired or wireless), a VPN connection is made to the UHG corporate network by a client agent on their device. The VPN agent on the device is enabled for automatic reconnect, automatic detection of trusted networks, and utilizes machine and user authentication. The deployed Employee VPN solution requires that when a UHG company-owned device is connected to a non-corporate network (wired or wireless) it must then connect to the UHG corporate network. This ensures that the endpoint and the ingress and egress connections are secure and protected per enterprise security standards and policies. This also ensures that all monitoring, filtering, data protection, and malware protection is in place regardless of what network is used to connect. It also allows for monitoring of vulnerabilities and configuration management of endpoints. Multi-factor authentication is accomplished by first using biometrics, physical smartcard, soft or hard token, and/or a complex pin/password for access to the company-owned device. Machine domain/LDAP authentication provides an additional layer of system level protection along with a digital machine certificate for machine level authentication. Endpoint protection uses a user digital certificate of system authentication.

Our secure email solution allows internal UnitedHealth Group users to send Registered Envelopes – emails which can only be opened by authorized recipients who authenticate themselves. This is accomplished as outlined below: An internal UnitedHealth Group user designates a sensitive email for 'secure delivery' by selecting a custom button on the email client toolbar; then sends the email in the normal manner. Prior to delivery, emails flagged for 'secure delivery' are encrypted by the Cisco Registered Envelope Service (CRES) and delivered to the recipient(s) in the form of a secured envelope. The recipient receives the message, opens the attached securedoc.html, and is prompted to log in using an individually assigned password they select when registering on the CRES server. Once they have successfully identified and authenticated themselves to the CRES server, the recipient retrieves the sensitive message. The recipient can reply to the received email using the Reply or ReplyAll buttons in the message, or send a new secured email to a UnitedHealth Group user by logging into https://res.cisco.com/websafe/""]","Hicks, Diane"

Ensure department personnel understand their roles and responsibilities during an event and are better prepared to respond effectively to business disruptions. This exercise is an opportunity for plan owners and recovery team members to ensure recovery strategies identified in the BC Plan are validated and sufficient to meet the Recovery Time Objectives required for the business. A formal exercise report, identifying any gaps, issues and/or enhancements identified through testing, is published and monitored for remediation. When the remediation plan is complete, the plan is certified by the appropriate Executive Leadership. Each business defines and prioritizes their recovery objectives in their business continuity plans. The Enterprise Resiliency & Response Office and the Enterprise Disaster Recovery Services organization have internal oversight and program governance responsibilities, and ensure our Program is in alignment with industry standards and best practices.

A workstation cannot connect to the network without a standard build. Servers and network equipment are delivered to data center docks by vetted vendor partners and data center facility personnel are notified for pickup. Data center facility personnel open all boxes and inspect devices prior to bringing to the data center. No cardboard is allowed in the data center. The server production environment across the data centers is retained in UnitedHealth Group’s asset management system and is updated regularly through inventory scanning tools and includes, but is not limited to, serial number, device name and IP address. Scanning tools run daily to maintain the accuracy of the data. Additional operational data is available in CMDB and other operational data stores, as needed, from the Enterprise Hosting Teams. UnitedHealth Group does not, as common practice, conduct bag checks on employees or third parties who enter or leave company facilities. Data center device removal processes follow an automated protocol with predetermined approval steps and monitoring of custodianship as devices are removed. Every server decommission is initiated by a Service Catalog request. The associated Service Catalog process flow produces a request to remove or repurpose the hardware. In cases of hardware removal for data center servers, all server hard drives are removed from the chassis and shredded onsite at the facility with a UnitedHealth Group staff member witness. The approved third-party vendor provides a Certificate of Destruction once complete. Until the on-site shred can be arranged, the server hard drives remain in the data center facility in a locked, secure cabinet until arrival of the approved third-party on-site destruction firm.

Assessments are conducted for critical locations on a rotating basis, and as part of our integration activities for new acquisitions. The Enterprise Resiliency & Response Office has access to these assessments and reflects them when assessing the residual risk in operations, when appropriate. UnitedHealth Group has developed an Enterprise Resiliency & Response Program that minimizes customer impact from disrupted service in a significant event or disaster while aiding compliance to published regulatory guidelines. Our plans are developed to address all natural and human-caused disasters (e.g., hurricanes, floods, fires, terrorism attacks, and disease pandemics). Our business continuity plans focus on critical business functions and planning for the worst-case scenario so that we can react quickly and efficiently, adding value to our business and customers through effective risk reduction, compliance with industry, contractual or regulatory standards, and safeguarding of our operations and assets. UnitedHealth Group's Business Continuity Management program is based on a number of relevant industry standards and frameworks; however, we have not sought formal certification under any specific framework. The plans are updated a minimum of twice annually. The business continuity plans are tested at a minimum annually, through a variety of exercise formats using scenarios that vary annually. Exercises may include structured walk-throughs, notification validation, tabletop event simulation, and large or full-scale simulations. UnitedHealth Group testing techniques include methods of exercising: methods of exercising: functional, large or full scale, tabletop and emergency response. Depending upon resources, budget, and infrastructure availability, any of the three prior mentioned exercises may be conducted. The Program uses an exercise roadmap to track what scenarios have been exercised in the past to ensure each exercise introduces a new situation that challenges the recovery team. Exercises are created and facilitated by the Program staff using scenarios that are tailored to the individual operations being exercised. A formal exercise report identifying any gaps, issues, and/or enhancements identified through testing is published and monitored for remediation. When the remediation plan is complete, the plan is certified by the appropriate Executive Leadership. This certification process must occur annually and is monitored by the Enterprise Resiliency & Response Steering Committee, comprised of senior executives across all business segments.""]","Carlson, Catherine"
61d5a8fc8fecd3770d08142a,Does your company utilize a command center?,Does your company utilize a command center? Are incident alert thresholds established?,"['Yes', ""UnitedHealth Group's Technology Command Center (TCC) performs enterprise monitoring, high priority incident management and Technology Center Event Management. The TCC is a 24x7x365 operation staffed with technical and operational employees. This group of employees is constantly monitoring the health of the Information Technology infrastructure and application portfolio supporting the business. The employees manage all high priority incidents for the enterprise. A high priority incident is defined as either a priority 1 or priority 2. High Priority incidents are typically identified in one of three ways: A monitoring event identifies a degraded condition causing an impact to a technology-enabled business function. Monitoring alert notifications related to infrastructure and applications are received by the TCC. All monitoring alerts are presented on large LCD (liquid crystal display) monitors in the TCC. The alerts are assessed by a TCC employee to validate impact. If a high priority incident is determined, an incident ticket is created. An incident is reported to the Information Technology Support Services (ITSS) by a user or application support personnel. The ITSS employee references Service Management documentation to determine if the incident should be escalated to high priority status to expedite resolution. The incident ticket is warm transferred from the ITSS to the TCC. A Service Level Owner (SLO) or Delegate of the main Business Service support group can initiate a war room for those services via the War Room Status Portal page through Rapid War Room. The TCC, using standard Information Technology Service Management's ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) for incident management process, initiates a WebEx conference with all necessary resources, including technical support personnel and Service Level Owner (SLO). The support personnel are notified by a text message page. The purpose for the resource engagement is to restore service either by resolving the incident or by implementing a work-around to restore business functionality until a permanent repair can be implemented. All activities performed to restore service are documented in the Service Management application by the TCC employee. The TCC employee manages the incident until it’s resolved and service is confirmed restored. There is no difference in process between business and off-hours. If the incident is causing a widespread impact to a Technology Center, a Technology Event Management process is invoked by the TCC. A second bridge is opened to engage Information Technology senior management and Disaster Recovery management. The business impact is assessed to determine if the event warrants the declaration of a Disaster. The TCC sends Impact Communicator notifications during P1/P2 Incidents that provide restoration status/activities and impact to business services. The notifications are automatically sent to recipients with matching subscriptions. The notifications are sent via an email and/or SMS message. The initial communication is sent within 15 minutes following the initiation of incident resolution. Following the initial communication, an update is sent within 30 minutes with incident resolution status. Additional updates are sent hourly until incident is resolved.""]","Mckenny, Jon"

61d5a8f38fecd3770d081329,Are formal business continuity procedures developed and documented?,Does your company have an event management team?,"['Yes', ""The Enterprise Resiliency and Response Organization is responsible for activating UnitedHealth Group’s Event Management Team (EMT) to respond to situations that cause disruption to our operations and/or to our external stakeholders. The primary purpose of the event management team is to provide a consistent and reliable approach for communication and engagement between all required parties necessary to manage events. Subject matter experts, both at the corporate and segment level, continue to manage actions within their functional teams. However, they will leverage the event management team as a forum to more quickly and reliably engage, communicate, and make decisions between teams. UnitedHealth Group’s Event Management Team assesses the event to determine if it is so catastrophic as to warrant a disaster declaration, and makes a recommendation to the Executive Leadership team for disaster declaration. Any member of the EMT Executive Leadership team has the authority to declare a business disaster. Information Technology (IT) disasters follow a separate declaration process due to the complexity of third party contracts and technology interdependencies. Only the Optum Technology Chief Information Officer, the Senior Vice President of Infrastructure Services, and the Director of Enterprise Disaster Recovery Services have the authority to declare an IT disaster. UnitedHealth Group's customers would be notified of the disaster via standard communication channels by their assigned Account Executive. Public Health Emergency and Pandemic Response: The event management team will work in collaboration with the public health emergency leads within each business segment to effectively implement the necessary disaster-related services. Each business segment must maintain procedures for implementation of necessary services including contacts and actions. The event management leader coordinates the cross-segment communication and response between these teams, the compliance organization, the communication organization, the enterprise bioterrorism and public health team, and other necessary UnitedHealth Group leadership. The Public Health Emergency Team: - Coordinates enterprise and segment response for implementation of necessary benefit changes and emergency support for members and providers - Notifies the Event Management Team of regulatory requirements for disaster-related services - Communicates with providers, members, customers, and media The UnitedHealth Group Event Management Plan outlines the management organization and communication process to be utilized to facilitate a timely response to events affecting our personnel, business operations, and site locations with the goal of avoiding or minimizing damage to the organization's profitability, reputation, and ability to operate. This plan identifies the event management team and outlines their key roles and responsibilities. The EMT is collectively responsible for managing the situation and making the critical decisions that drive remediation and coordination with various internal and external stakeholders as determined by the nature of the event and the short and long-term impact on the organization. The event management team also supports execution on the event management decisions and provides central coordination of communications, resources, personnel, issues, and other information through the notification and response phases of event management. As the recovery activities begin, the Event Management Team and Plan are utilized to provide a consistent and reliable approach for communication, engagement, and decision making between the Business Continuity Recovery Teams, Disaster Recovery Teams, Public Health Emergency Teams, and other internal and external parties necessary to effectively manage the event. The documented Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery procedures are activated, as needed, for the event and include business restoration processes relevant for each critical function. The EMT utilizes an automated notification system to quickly convene members of the necessary teams to manage and direct the recovery efforts including those from the Site Emergency Response Teams, Business Continuity Teams, Disaster Recovery Teams, and Public Health Emergency Response Teams. This plan also documents: - Event management process including identification, escalation, notification, and response channels, as well as, roles and responsibilities of the event management team - Established standards and checklists for the event management team including, but not limited to: - command center activation - damage assessment of people, information, and property - risk management and safety - technology impact and response - employee, media, and customer communications - Disaster declaration standards""]","Carlson, Catherine"

61d5a8f98fecd3770d0813ce,Change  Management Overview Process - Emergency/High and Critical Risk Changes,N/A,"[""UnitedHealth Group’s business continuity, disaster recovery, and emergency management standards align with industry best practices including the BS 25999 standard (2006), NFPA 1600 update (2010), ASIS Security standard (2010), and ISO 22301 (2012). The program is reviewed against each new standard and evolving professional practice on an on-going basis. Security controls must be in place to control access to pre-authorized emergency accounts. Any access utilizing pre-authorized emergency accounts must be logged for audit purposes and the appropriate Information Owners and system administrators must be notified. Upon completion of any emergency work, pre-defined accounts must be disabled and passwords must be reset. All changes to UnitedHealth Group's production environment follow UnitedHealth Group's Change Management Policies and Procedures to ensure that standardized methods and procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all changes. This process is used to minimize the impact of change-related incidents upon service quality and consequently to improve the day-to-day operations of the organization. Changes to an application or to the infrastructure include clear requirements, a back-out plan, appropriate test plan, and are approved by the appropriate Information Technology (IT) owner for implementation into production. All reasonable and industry practices are applied to ensure any system changes are free from defect. The method of implementation, manual or automated, will depend on the change activity, what is being implemented, how it is being implemented, and what group is performing the change. That will determine whether the change is implemented in a manual or automated fashion. UnitedHealth Group provides a shared/common processing support infrastructure for all customers. Additionally, many of UnitedHealth Group's systems perform 'back-end' processing and are not directly accessible by customers. Therefore, customers would only be notified in the event of significant functionality changes for applications they access directly (e.g., the myuhc.com member portal) or those which would materially affect business operations. The Change Management process requires Change Advisory Board (CAB) Approval for High and Critical Risk Changes, through a daily (Monday through Friday) CAB Meeting, and/or review via Virtual CAB. In the rare occasion where a Change must be implemented on an expedited basis, and does not have enough lead time for approval through the standard Change Management process, the Change can be implemented via our Incident Management process. These Changes will be reviewed on a War Room managed by the Command Center, which will confirm the business need for expedited deployment, confirm all required resources are engaged, and provide Change Approval.""]","Hammer, Christopher"

630e511d13b39b32be15c8fc,Describe Controls Implemented for Protecting Hypervisor Systems,Describing controls implemented for protecting hypervisor systems.,"[""Hypervisors have a published baseline standard that reside in an internal repository. Our team maintains these policies based on industry guidance like CIS Benchmarks, IRS-1075 Controls, and MARS-E requirements. These baselines are then made a part of the build template for new hosts that are being deployed for service in the enterprise. Hypervisors are also subject to the same hardening standards as our servers and applications as outlined below. UnitedHealth Group has established a robust security infrastructure, which includes a documented process for securing and hardening the operating system platforms and applications that store and process data. This process includes: Base installation and configuration standards Strong password controls Changing default password Maintaining access controls Removing unnecessary services Removing known vulnerability configurations Version management All UnitedHealth Group network connections, whether outbound or inbound, are filtered through a corporate approved firewall, layers of firewalls, and/or isolated from internal network connections. The firewall is configured to protect against unauthorized intrusions and limit external access to the internal company networks. Intrusion detection technology is also deployed throughout our security architecture model. Vulnerability assessment technology is used throughout our operational infrastructure to assist with detecting and addressing operating system risks. Vulnerability assessments are performed at the external entry points, as well, to ensure ongoing appropriate control posture for UnitedHealth Group's customer and proprietary information. UnitedHealth Group utilizes Symantec Endpoint Protection software for our servers and Microsoft Defender for our workstations, which detects macro virus, non-macro virus, adware, dialers, hack tools, joke programs, remote access, spyware, and trackware. Security controls are established for system, application, and data layers based upon functional roles and responsibilities being performed. Access to information technology systems may only be granted based upon a documented business justification and approval by Management. Users are granted minimum necessary access to allow them to perform their job responsibilities. To access UnitedHealth Group information technology systems, all users must authenticate with a unique user ID and password to verify the person or entity seeking access is the one claimed. Periodic reviews of user accounts must occur to ensure the appropriate minimum privileges are granted and accounts of unauthorized users have been removed. UnitedHealth Group utilizes an industry standard full disk encryption product on its laptops, which meets the NIST encryption standards. UnitedHealth Group continues to implement new solutions with advanced technologies to ensure customer data is protected. At the beginning of 2007, UnitedHealth Group began maintaining its own tape management storage facility within its managed data centers. UnitedHealth Group employs a series of robust and secure transmission solutions that support file transfer and email. Information security policies, procedures and technical protocol, along with operation protocols ensure the control of secured information transmissions. In addition, UnitedHealth Group encryption technology standards require a minimum key length of 256-bits for secret (symmetric) encryption and 2048-bits for public/private (asymmetric) encryption. These are the minimum standards. Longer key lengths may have been implemented within specific environments, based on risk.""]","Douglas, Benjamin"

When an approved VPN user logs on to an endpoint through a non-corporate network (wired or wireless), a VPN connection is made to the UHG corporate network by a client agent on their device. The VPN agent on the device is enabled for automatic reconnect, automatic detection of trusted networks, and utilizes machine and user authentication.

This also ensures that all monitoring, filtering, data protection, and malware protection is in place regardless of what network is used to connect. It also allows for monitoring of vulnerabilities and configuration management of endpoints. Multi-factor authentication is accomplished by first using biometrics, physical smartcard, soft or hard token, and/or a complex pin/password for access to the company-owned device. Machine domain/LDAP authentication provides an additional layer of system level protection along with a digital machine certificate for machine level authentication.

No', ""Modems/Dialup are not used for external connections. All connectivity must use the remote access Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. Information assets that are connected to UnitedHealth Group networks must not be connected to modems, unless business justification exists and a risk review has been completed by the Enterprise Information Security Organization. Once approved, modem use must be safeguarded. Out-of-band (OOB) modems are limited to non-network connected devices with two layers of authentication in place. Out of band modems are used only by the Network Engineering support staff in the event that all other forms of network communications do not exist. A password protected OOB modem is connected to a Terminal Access Device (TAD), which in turn requires a second password for access via the modem. The TAD connects only to the console port of the network device for emergency maintenance access for reboots, etc. The network devices also require a third password to access the console controls. UnitedHealth Group complies with all applicable regulatory requirements regarding the security and protection of sensitive data. Compliance is supported by UnitedHealth Group's established policies and standards, which take into consideration industry practices, regulatory requirements, ISO standards, and customer perspectives. UnitedHealth Group acknowledges the risk that would be created should an end user have the ability to connect a computer to an analog phone line using a modem. In UnitedHealth Group's environment, we deploy digital IP telephony to the desktop. As such, there are no analog phone lines deployed that could be used for a modem by an end user. Since UnitedHealth Group uses a layered approach to information security, additional protections are in place at the workstation level, such as a software and hardware inventory system that can be used to detect unauthorized changes to workstations and restrictions placed on the provisioning of local workstation admin rights. For these reasons, UnitedHealth Group does not conduct regular war dialing exercises.""]","Brick, Audrey"

This monitoring is performed on a 24/7 basis by UHG's Security Operations Center. Formal security incident response capability is tracked and reported to Information Security leadership in weekly and monthly reports containing process metrics and results. Periodic internal and external vulnerability scans, penetration tests, audits, and other security assessments identify areas for potential enhancement and ensure controls are operating effectively. The operating maturity of our cyber security program is benchmarked against a continuously updated set of control requirements based upon the HITRUST framework and is subject to an annual external certification process by HITRUST Alliance. - In collaboration with other business partners (Privacy, Legal, Corporate Communications, Technology, Executive Leadership), Information Security routinely exercises its business continuation and cyberattack response plans. Post-exercise reviews are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the plans and the company's response. As needed, this review stimulates additional enhancements to areas identified for improvement. We also provide annual security-awareness and privacy training to all employees, including part-time and temporary, which covers timely and relevant topics, including social engineering, phishing, password protection, confidential data protection, asset use and mobile security. New hires must successfully complete UHG's New Hire Security and Privacy training course during their onboarding.

Yes, tier 2 (recovery within 24 hours). Is there a documented disaster recovery plan for this solution? Yes Who is responsible for the disaster recovery plan for this solution? Optum UnitedHealth Group developed an Enterprise Resiliency & Response Program that minimizes customer impact from disrupted service in a significant event or disaster, while aiding compliance to published regulatory guidelines. We have plans to address all natural and human-caused disasters (i.e. hurricanes, floods, fires, terrorism, and pandemics). The business continuity plans focus on critical business functions and planning for the worst-case scenario so that we can react quickly and efficiently, adding value to our business and customers through effective risk reduction, compliance with industry, contractual or regulatory standards, and safeguarding of operations and assets. UnitedHealth Group's business impact analysis and subsequent business continuity plans are written to accommodate the following four scenarios: Loss of Facility: Complete interruption of facilities without access to its equipment, local data, and content. The interruption may impact a single site or multiple sites in a geographic region. Recovery from anything less than complete interruption will be achieved by using appropriate portions of the plan. Loss of Critical People: Complete interruption with 100% loss of personnel within the first 24 hours and 50% loss of personnel long-term. The interruption may impact a single site or multiple sites in a geographic area. Recovery from anything less than complete interruption will be achieved by using appropriate portions of the plan. Loss of Critical Systems: Complete interruption and/or access of critical systems and data located at the various UnitedHealth Group data centers for an extended period of time. Recovery from anything less than complete interruption will be achieved by using appropriate portions of the plan. Loss of Critical Vendor: Complete interruption in a service or supply provided by a third-party vendor. Recovery from anything less than complete interruption will be achieved by using appropriate portions of the plan. The impact of the operational loss due to one, or all, of these scenarios is assessed as part of the original Business Impact Analysis and annually thereafter. The business continuity plans are updated quarterly and exercised annually. Business continuity plans are leveraged as needed to address all forms of emergencies, which may impact business operations including short and long-term events. Examples of short-term events include power outages and winter weather office closings. These plans also address more severe, long-term situations, such as building fires and major hurricanes. As a matter of good practice, UnitedHealth Group does not disclose specific information concerning business disruptions. UnitedHealth Group has never needed to implement our disaster recovery plans in response to a catastrophic outage of technology at our production data centers. Business functions classified as critical generally provide for near immediate failover of core services by leveraging geographically dispersed, redundant operations and maintaining a recovery time objective of 72 hours or less. The plans are written to respond to a disaster lasting a minimum of 90 days. In the event a disaster impacts our members, we will comply with any and all emergency orders mandated by the state Department of Insurance, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), or Health and Human Services (HHS). The Event Management Team continually monitors for natural disasters and the potential impact on healthcare delivery services. If the situation warrants it, emergency provisions may be provided, even if not mandated. Is there a documented disaster recovery plan that is exercised, reviewed, and approved at least annually and after significant changes? Yes How frequently is a fail-over exercise of the disaster recovery plan conducted? Annually Please specify the recovery solution for this solution.

The various technologies offer a defense in-depth approach to securing and monitoring the network.Network based intrusion detection systems are deployed throughout UnitedHealth Group's network infrastructure to help ensure unauthorized actions are not regularly attempted or obtained. Real-time detection of known attack characteristics (e.g., denial of service attacks, viruses, etc.) is enabled. The intrusion detection systems are tuned on a regular basis to respond to specific threats or based on intruder profiles and patterns. The design of the intrusion detection systems is reviewed periodically to ensure that system or network changes have not reduced the effectiveness of the systems.UnitedHealth Group's Optum Technology Security Operations Center (SOC) consists of Network Security personnel who provide 24/7/365 monitoring of the network via industry standard monitoring tools. The SOC monitors a dashboard that has downstream processes, which are followed to ensure the integrity of UnitedHealth Group's network from intrusions. Accountable technology owners are alerted based on the classification of the event.Log reviews are variable and based on reporting criteria. Therefore, various audit logs may be reviewed on a daily, weekly, monthly, semi-annual, and annual basis.

Please briefly discuss relevant security controls with your response.",N/A,"Optum is able to provide applications and services that meet or exceed the HIPAA requirements of our covered entity customers through its commitment to the necessary administrative, technical and physical safeguards.Regardless of the particular application, customer, or project, basic tenets always apply. These tenets include authentication, role-based access to data, logging key data elements that reveal who accessed what, appropriate education for those with access to sensitive data, and monitoring programs to maintain program compliance. As an example, our software products allow an administrator to define roles as appropriate for their particular organization. These roles can then be used to control access to confidential data. Internally, Optum enforces technical restrictions to make sure that individuals are only able to access data required to perform their specific job function.The Optum systems, backed by trained employees and strategically designed policies and procedures, will employ the highest level of security when storing, processing, hosting, or transmitting our customer’s PHI. To accomplish this, Optum meticulously monitors and controls all customer data from the moment it arrives to the moment it is returned to the customer.Our overall approach can best be described as creating systems and business processes capable of rapidly transforming and hosting health care data while maintaining security at all times.Details on this system include the following:All data, systems and technologies involved in the storage, processing, hosting and transmission of data are monitored by our state-of-the-art monitoring system 24 hours per day.Access to any of the systems involved in storing, processing or transmitting data is tightly controlled.Employees are only able to access and manipulate the systems and/or data required to complete their specific job and project responsibilities.New organizational positions backed by training and comprehensive security and technology policies have been created in an effort to control and coordinate all movement of customer data.Select employees have been charged with the responsibility to securely transfer and receive customer data. These employees have been provided with additional security training.Optum uses the latest in firewall and network intrusion detection technology.Optum systems and customer PHI are protected by a multi-tiered, anti-viral system.The Optum network is compartmentalized by firewalls to separate customer PHI from Optum employees and customers.Experienced Optum system engineers centrally monitor and proactively manage the Optum enterprise network.Optum software solutions are designed to run in highly secure environments and are capable of scaling to meet customer needs. Because the underlying data for these applications include Protected Health Information (PHI), as defined in the HIPAA legislation, it is critical that all users and administrators adhere to their internal HIPAA compliance practices when installing, administering, and using these applications. Our software products can be easily integrated into existing HIPAA compliance programs.",Ravisankar Subbaraj

The methods of logging include: Application level custom developed logging modules and enabling the internal auditing functionality of platform and network level devices. All security event logs are stored in a centralized logging system and are monitored 24x7 by a network security team. Some examples of logged activities include, but are not limited to: Successful and failed login attempts and logoffs Remote access connections Additions, deletions, and modifications to user accounts/privileges Attempts to perform unauthorized functions System administrator activities Changes to system configurations and security settings System startup and shutdown Backup activities Changes to production application functionality Access to protected information Additions, deletions, and modifications to security/audit log parameters Access to, modification, or deletion of audit log information Do the logs contain any sensitive information such as PII, SNN, passwords, etc? No How are logs protected from unauthorized access or tampering? UnitedHealth Group information technology systems and network activity are monitored for unauthorized actions to ensure information security controls are not tampered with or bypassed. UnitedHealth Group employs several technologies to ensure the security of the network and devices that connect to it. The various technologies offer a defense in-depth approach to securing and monitoring the network. Network based intrusion detection systems are deployed throughout UnitedHealth Group\'s network infrastructure to help ensure unauthorized actions are not regularly attempted or obtained. Real-time detection of known attack characteristics (e.g., denial of service attacks, viruses, etc.) is enabled. The intrusion detection systems are tuned on a regular basis to respond to specific threats or based on intruder profiles and patterns. The design of the intrusion detection systems is reviewed periodically to ensure that system or network changes have not reduced the effectiveness of the systems. UnitedHealth Group\'s Optum Technology Security Operations Center (SOC) consists of Network Security personnel who provide 24/7/365 monitoring of the network via industry standard monitoring tools. The SOC monitors a dashboard that has downstream processes, which are followed to ensure the integrity of UnitedHealth Group\'s network from intrusions. Accountable technology owners are alerted based on the classification of the event. Log reviews are variable and based on reporting criteria. Therefore, various audit logs may be reviewed on a daily, weekly, monthly, semi-annual, and annual basis. Any audit logs containing criteria that either identifies a trend of inappropriate use/transactions or triggers, an ""alert"" shall be reviewed promptly and addressed accordingly. Outside of the application system ID, does any of the vendor users have access to the logs? No Are logs regularly reviewed for analysis or detection of unauthorized activities?

Whenever possible, development/engineering and production maintenance duties must be assigned to separate employees or contractors to maintain segregation of duties and limit the risk of unauthorized changes or access to data.
Developers should be restricted from modifying production source code or production data, and engineers should be restricted from modifying system settings, except in emergencies.
Database Administrators should be restricted from adding, inserting or updating production data. Segregation of Duties is in place between various roles.

UnitedHealth Group employs several technologies to ensure the security of the network and devices that connect to it. The various technologies offer a defense in-depth approach to securing and monitoring the network.Network based intrusion detection systems are deployed throughout UnitedHealth Group's network infrastructure to help ensure unauthorized actions are not regularly attempted or obtained. Real-time detection of known attack characteristics (e.g., denial of service attacks, viruses, etc.) is enabled. The intrusion detection systems are tuned on a regular basis to respond to specific threats or based on intruder profiles and patterns. The design of the intrusion detection systems is reviewed periodically to ensure that system or network changes have not reduced the effectiveness of the systems.UnitedHealth Group's Optum Technology Security Operations Center (SOC) consists of Network Security personnel who provide 24/7/365 monitoring of the network via industry standard monitoring tools. The SOC monitors a dashboard that has downstream processes, which are followed to ensure the integrity of UnitedHealth Group's network from intrusions. Accountable technology owners are alerted based on the classification of the event.Log reviews are variable and based on reporting criteria. Therefore, various audit logs may be reviewed on a daily, weekly, monthly, semi-annual, and annual basis. Any audit logs containing criteria that either identifies a trend of inappropriate use/transactions or triggers, an ""alert"" shall be reviewed promptly and addressed accordingly.","Shifman, Allison"

Full volume data from Healthplex data center was migrated to the Optum Data center ahead of the Disaster Recovery test. The application was validated to be working as designed in the production environment. The next step was to shut down the primary nodes for the Healthplex database and other servers in the Optum environment, and then to fail over to the secondary site for Healthplex database and other servers. Healthplex was then brought up in the secondary site and testing was completed for all functional capabilities at the secondary Optum site to confirm successful Disaster Recovery of the Healthplex database and application. No issues were identified during the Disaster Recovery test and no issues were identified with the database or the application as part of validation testing of the functional capabilities. Disaster Testing is an annual requirement for all Optum applications and the Healthplex application will execute another Disaster Recovery test in calendar year 2023. The exact date is to be determined based upon Optum enterprise Disaster Recovery schedules. But, a DR test will be completed prior to the end of 2023 calendar year.']","Bailey, Ronald J"

These tenets include authentication, role-based access to data, logging key data elements that reveal who accessed what, appropriate education for those with access to sensitive data, and monitoring programs to maintain program compliance. As an example, our software products allow an administrator to define roles as appropriate for their particular organization. These roles can then be used to control access to confidential data. Internally, Optum enforces technical restrictions to make sure that individuals are only able to access data required to perform their specific job function.The Optum systems, backed by trained employees and strategically designed policies and procedures, will employ the highest level of security when storing, processing, hosting, or transmitting our customer’s PHI. To accomplish this, Optum meticulously monitors and controls all customer data from the moment it arrives to the moment it is returned to the customer.Our overall approach can best be described as creating systems and business processes capable of rapidly transforming and hosting health care data while maintaining security at all times.Details on this system include the following:All data, systems and technologies involved in the storage, processing, hosting and transmission of data are monitored by our state-of-the-art monitoring system 24 hours per day.Access to any of the systems involved in storing, processing or transmitting data is tightly controlled.Employees are only able to access and manipulate the systems and/or data required to complete their specific job and project responsibilities.New organizational positions backed by training and comprehensive security and technology policies have been created in an effort to control and coordinate all movement of customer data.Select employees have been charged with the responsibility to securely transfer and receive customer data. These employees have been provided with additional security training.Optum uses the latest in firewall and network intrusion detection technology.Optum systems and customer PHI are protected by a multi-tiered, anti-viral system.The Optum network is compartmentalized by firewalls to separate customer PHI from Optum employees and customers.Experienced Optum system engineers centrally monitor and proactively manage the Optum enterprise network.Optum software solutions are designed to run in highly secure environments and are capable of scaling to meet customer needs. Because the underlying data for these applications include Protected Health Information (PHI), as defined in the HIPAA legislation, it is critical that all users and administrators adhere to their internal HIPAA compliance practices when installing, administering, and using these applications. Our software products can be easily integrated into existing HIPAA compliance programs.","Subbaraj, Ravisankar"

Because the underlying data for this application includes protected health information (PHI), as defined in the HIPAA legislation, it is critical that all users and administrators of the Impact Pro software adhere to the customer’s HIPAA compliance program requirements when installing, administering and using this application.Solution-specific security features include:User AuthenticationUser authentication is the process to identify an individual with the necessary security credentials. When a user logs on to the Impact Pro application, it will validate the user ID and password information based on the master table of potential users. Hosted customers will use One Healthcare ID (multi-factor authentication) and provides an option of in-built User Management to access health information through the Impact Pro application. Standalone customers can select either Impact Pro's in-built form-based authentication or Windows-based authentication. The application will encrypt the password information before it is stored in the database for form-based authentication.User AuthorizationUsing the credentials supplied by successful authentication, Impact Pro uses role-based security during the authorization process. The customer grants access to specific components of the Impact Pro software based on the user profile. Designated administrators of the application will establish user profiles. This approach greatly simplifies the process of establishing the appropriate access level and control for each user by assigning users to pre-defined roles making certain that users can only access what their job function requires.Automatic LogoffThe automatic logoff feature can prevent unauthorized access under someone else’s user ID, if they leave their workstation unattended for an extended period. Regardless of deployment option selected, the designated Impact Pro administrator within your organization can customize this feature.","Subbaraj, Ravisankar"
