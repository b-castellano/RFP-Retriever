Question: Have you had any reportable breaches in the last year? If so, please provide a summary.
 "Our company does not disclose details concerning security or privacy incidents. However, we have a trained staff proficient in various disciplines such as Compliance, Privacy, Security, Information Risk Management, Legal Counsel, and executive leadership, who provide expertise during this process as circumstances warrant. We take any alleged or confirmed incident seriously and investigate all reported matters. When we become aware of a potential or actual incident, a systematic investigation is promptly undertaken to analyze, contain, recover, and implement post-incident management including the review of any customer, member, and regulator notification obligations. Corrective action often includes employee retraining, coaching, and review to determine if disciplinary action is appropriate. We have designated a Security Incident Response Team to provide oversight in the handling of security and privacy-related incidents across the enterprise. Each UnitedHealth Group business segmentâ€™s information security and privacy officer serves as a member of the Security Incident Response Team. Our Company also receives, tracks and responds, when applicable, to reports of privacy incidents from external parties including members, patients, customers and regulatory bodies. We utilize an incident tracking, workflow, and incident risk evaluation solution. The investigation details, legal risk analysis, notification obligations, and any mitigation and remediation steps taken are documented in the case and retained for the applicable timeframe as required by law and Company policy. Notifications are made in a format that is compliant with the applicable regulatory regime(s) and any contractual obligations. Our Company is responsible for the breach notification and remediation process at no cost to the customer. When required, or if elected by the business, we offer impacted individuals identity theft prevention and mitigation services at no cost to them for a period of time that complies with applicable law.
