Backups may include but are not limited to: Master files databases Transactions files System programs/utilities, Application software Parameter settings, or System documentation.

Connection to backup server is across the UnitedHealth Group Wide Area Network, data is written to the alternate location, eliminating the need for third party offsite storage. Backup procedures are further validated by the successful restoration of data (accidental/errant deletions by users), when requested and by regularly scheduled in house and off-site disaster recovery exercises. UnitedHealth Group also utilizes a pre-constructed application specific environment called Stage to periodically test disaster recovery and ad-hoc restores. The results of these tests are confidential to UnitedHealth Group and are not shared outside the company. If required, a conference call can be scheduled with the appropriate Subject Matter Experts to discuss this topic.
