Question: Please describe how you secure data at rest.
Answer: "We encrypt data at rest without regard to its content or type at the storage media (device) level on both disk and tape. The standard/methodology utilized for encryption is Data at Rest Encryption (DARE) using Self Encrypting Drives (SED) with a minimum AES-256 bit cypher key and validated FIPS 140-2 compliance. When a storage array is placed into production, the encryption key is enabled. All data that is subsequently written to that array, regardless of type, origin or classification, is encrypted. Encryption keys are created entirely within the systems themselves and are not visible, recognizable, or changeable by any administrator. There is no external list. Even if encryption is turned off, encrypted data cannot be “read” or deciphered by any individual. The encryption keys are managed several different ways depending on environment: In the mainframe environment, the encryption keys are managed remotely using the IBM product SKLM (Secure Key Lifecycle Manager). This remote key manager is responsible for any maintenance related to the array encryption keys. In the distributed core environment, the encryption keys are either managed remotely using the HP product ESKM (Enterprise Secure Key Manager) This remote key manager is responsible for any maintenance related to the array encryption keys. OR For the arrays, the encryption keys are managed locally on the Storage array. The keys are created, stored and duplicated within the memory/controller subsystem of the array. Secondary backups of these keys are created and stored on the array management station in case of storage array failure.[61d5a8e48fecd3770d08119b]"<|im_end|>
