Question: Does your company perform vulnerability assessments?
 "Yes, vulnerability assessments are conducted during development and throughout the life of the information system. Penetration tests of UnitedHealth Group’s external web applications are performed annually by third party industry-leading security vendors. Internal penetration testing is done by the Ethical Hacking team. Standard operating procedure is to leverage a risk-based approach to identify specific applications to be included in each annual test. The external vulnerability scanning, performed as part of the penetration tests, includes scans for web application vulnerabilities in accordance with OWASP guidance. In addition to the external network penetration testing, UnitedHealth Group performs periodic Application web-based scanning, and static code analysis for external facing critical business applications. As a matter of good practice, UnitedHealth Group does not disclose detailed information concerning security assessment results. Executive summary-level reports are available to senior management, which provide an overview of the process and results tabulated by severity level. The remediation of potential issues identified during scans is addressed based on the residual risk exposure.
